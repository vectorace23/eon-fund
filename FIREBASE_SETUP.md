# 🔥 Firebase Setup Guide for EON Internal Platform

## **Why Firebase?**
Firebase provides real-time database functionality that allows messages to be visible across all devices and computers instantly. This is exactly what you need for team collaboration.

## **🚀 Step-by-Step Setup:**

### **1. Create Firebase Project**

2. Click "Create a project"
3. Name it: `eon-internal-platform`
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

### **2. Enable Firestore Database**
1. In your project, click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (for now)
4. Select a location close to your team (e.g., `us-east1`)
5. Click "Enable"

### **3. Get Your Configuration**
1. Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to "Project Overview"
2. Select "Project settings"
3. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
4. Click the web icon `</>`
5. Register app with name: `EON Internal Platform`
6. Copy the config object that looks like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyC...",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abc123"
};
```

### **4. Update Your Dashboard**
1. Open `dashboard-firebase.html`
2. Replace the placeholder config with your real config
3. Save the file

### **5. Test the System**

2. Login from one computer as Mukund
3. Send a message
4. Login from another computer as Ronin

## **🔒 Security Rules (Important!)**
After testing, update your Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /eon-chat/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Only for testing!
    }
  }

**⚠️ Note:** The current rules allow anyone to read/write. For production, you'll want proper authentication.
